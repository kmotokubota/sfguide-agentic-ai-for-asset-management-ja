# Major Earthquake Disrupts Taiwan Semiconductor Production

**Event Date**: 21 January 2025  
**Region**: Taiwan (TW)  
**Event Type**: Natural Disaster  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Source**: Global Risk Monitor

## Executive Summary

A magnitude 6.4 earthquake struck Taiwan on January 21, 2025, followed by several significant aftershocks, causing disruption to semiconductor manufacturing facilities across the island. The earthquake affected major fabrication plants operated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and other key players in the global semiconductor supply chain.

Initial assessments indicated production impacts across affected facilities, with wafers in process requiring scrapping. However, TSMC and other manufacturers worked diligently to recover lost production, demonstrating the operational resilience of Taiwan's semiconductor industry. This event highlights second-order risks to companies dependent on Taiwanese semiconductor production.

## Impact Assessment

### Direct Impact: Semiconductor Manufacturing

- **TSMC Facilities**: Advanced fabrication plants (7nm, 5nm, and 3nm nodes) experienced temporary disruption
- **Production Impact**: Certain wafers in process were impacted and had to be scrapped
- **Recovery Response**: Manufacturers worked tirelessly to recover much of the lost production
- **Operational Resilience**: TSMC's Q1 2025 revenue came in slightly above guidance midpoint despite the disruption

### Affected Sectors

**Information Technology** (High Impact)
- Graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI and gaming applications
- Mobile phone processors and system-on-chip (SoC) components
- High-performance computing chips
- Data centre processors

**Consumer Discretionary** (Medium-High Impact)
- Automotive semiconductor components
- Consumer electronics chips
- Electric vehicle (EV) power management systems
- Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) chips

### Downstream Supply Chain Analysis

#### First-Order Dependencies
Companies with direct manufacturing relationships with affected Taiwanese facilities:
- NVIDIA Corporation - primary GPU manufacturing partner
- Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) - CPU and GPU production
- Apple Inc. - mobile processor production
- Qualcomm - mobile SoC manufacturing

#### Second-Order Dependencies
Industries and companies dependent on first-order suppliers:
- Automotive manufacturers requiring semiconductor components
- Consumer electronics brands
- Cloud computing service providers
- Telecommunications equipment suppliers

## Risk Implications

### Supply Chain Disruption Risk
- **Initial Impact**: Production disruption in days following the earthquake
- **Recovery**: Demonstrated operational resilience with rapid production recovery
- **Inventory**: Most technology companies maintain 4-8 weeks of semiconductor inventory
- **Lesson Learned**: Taiwan semiconductor industry showed strong disaster recovery capabilities

### Financial Impact Estimates
- **Production Recovery**: Much of lost production was recovered through operational efforts
- **Revenue Impact**: TSMC reported Q1 2025 revenue slightly above guidance midpoint
- **Margin Resilience**: Operational efficiency maintained despite disruption

### Geopolitical Considerations
This event highlights strategic considerations in concentrated semiconductor production:
- Taiwan accounts for approximately 60% of global contract chip manufacturing
- Demonstrated operational resilience in seismically active region
- Continued focus on supply chain resilience and geographic diversification by customers

## Company Responses

### TSMC Q1 2025 Earnings Commentary
In their April 2025 earnings call, TSMC management provided the following update:

> "On January 21, Taiwan experienced a 6.4 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale, followed by several significant aftershocks. Although a certain number of wafers in process were impacted and had to be scrapped, we worked tirelessly and were able to recover much of the lost production, demonstrating the resilience of our operation in Taiwan."

### Customer Response
Major customers including NVIDIA and AMD have issued supply chain updates confirming:
- Continued partnership with TSMC for advanced node production
- Confidence in TSMC's operational resilience
- Ongoing geographic diversification planning for long-term supply chain resilience

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Assessment (Days 1-7)
1. **Exposure Quantification**: Calculate direct and indirect exposure to affected facilities
2. **Inventory Analysis**: Assess current semiconductor inventory levels across portfolio companies
3. **Supply Chain Mapping**: Identify multi-hop dependencies through supply chain relationships
4. **Communication**: Engage with portfolio company management to understand specific impacts

### Short-Term Monitoring (Weeks 2-8)
1. **Production Updates**: Track facility restoration progress and revised production schedules
2. **Earnings Guidance**: Monitor Q1 2025 earnings calls for supply chain impact commentary
3. **Customer Updates**: Review NVIDIA, AMD, and Apple supply chain statements
4. **Sector Analysis**: Assess differential impacts across technology sub-sectors

### Strategic Considerations (Months 3-12)
1. **Supply Chain Resilience**: Favour companies with diversified semiconductor sourcing
2. **Regional Diversification**: Monitor increased investment in semiconductor production outside Taiwan
3. **Disaster Recovery**: Assess companies' disaster recovery and business continuity capabilities
4. **Capital Investment**: Track investments in alternative manufacturing capacity

## Technical Details

**Seismic Event Characteristics**:
- Magnitude: 6.4 (Richter scale)
- Date: 21 January 2025
- Location: Taiwan
- Aftershocks: Several significant aftershocks recorded

**Facility Status**:
- TSMC demonstrated operational resilience
- Production recovery achieved through diligent efforts
- Q1 2025 guidance maintained despite disruption
- Full production capability restored

## Market Implications

**Observed Market Reactions**:
- Technology sector showed initial volatility following event
- Rapid recovery as production restoration was confirmed
